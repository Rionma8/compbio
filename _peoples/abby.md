**[Sophie Abby](https://www.timc.fr/en/sophie-abby)** received a bi-disciplinary education in biology and
computational sciences. She is an evolutionary biologist, particularly
interested in the mechanisms of diversification of prokaryotes (archaea and
bacteria). She studies these at different scales: from enzymes, to macromolecular
complexes, and genome dynamics with respect to environmental adaptations. She also develops 
methods in the field of comparative genomics and phylogenomics, in particular for genome annotation.
