Postdoc and students from a wide range of backgrounds including computer
science, statistics, bioinformatics, and biology, and interested in
computational work, are encouraged to contact us to discuss possibilities of
internships, PhD thesis, and postdoc fellowships.

## Position offers

We have funding to recruit interns and PhD students over the next few years.
Feel free to contact us to discuss more opportunities.

- [Master 1/2 or equivalent internship - Deconvolution approaches for
  detecting systems in prokaryotic
  genomes](https://tree-timc.github.io/compbio/files/2022_M2_homologs_SS.pdf)

  **bioinformatics, computer science, or maths profile** We are looking to
  develop unsupervised machine learning approaches to detect protein systems
  in prokaryotic genomes. (3 to 6 months).
